PowerPointClicker

Author: Matthew Johnson (Partner of L3DC)

This program is designed to serve as a clicker, for programs such as PowerPoint. 
One finger clicks forward and two fingers clicks backwards. 
Five fingers escapes out of the slide show and eight fingers quit the Clicker. 
Updates coming soon.
